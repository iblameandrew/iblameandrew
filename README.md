# Hi, I'm a philosopher, engineer, and researcher.

I'm currently exploring the intersection of consciousness, physics, and computation. My work is grounded in a "World of Wheels" cosmovision, viewing the universe as a nested system of harmonic oscillators. I believe that true breakthroughs in artificial intelligence will not come from scaling current architectures alone, but from a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of nature.

My ruminiating over the years argues that current AI models are endowed with wave-like features during training, but lack so in their weights during inference ‚Äîthey can approximate functions but lack the feedback mechanisms that drive genuine updated understanding. This has led me to explore nature-inspired methods and control theory, like PID loops, as a path toward more robust and conscious-like AI. I'm particularly interested in the science of loops and oscillators as a precise language for describing consciousness. You can find my musings on these topics in my blog, where I dissect everything from the emergent complexity of MLPs to the metaphysical implications of gravity and attention.

## üî≠ Current Projects

### Portals

_Right now my profile is a demo managed by a portals agent using my own unconscious as extracted after writing the story of my life - the agent then dives into recommendation engines and deep searches compatible videos using Top, Left, Right and Bottom operators._

I am currently developing **Portals**, a future open source platform for automatic videogame synthesis based on a person's elicited focal points of attention.

The core idea behind Portals is to create a system that can translate the subtle, often unconscious, points of interest of a persons hierarchy of values and affordances, into a coherent visual narrative. Instead of relying solely on explicit text prompts, Portals will leverage novel techniques to capture and interpret a user's focus, generating a playable videogame that is deeply resonant with their internal state. Explore your own mind: is it ugly? Face yourself as you are - is it pretty? See how often you've been naive in life.

Previously i was woking on crafting stories from media, but as i discovered places like Dungeon AI already having the concept pinned down, i decided to scale up and combine this project, with more recent developments. Heres a previous sketch of what that used to look like, and what Portals once open sourced will borrow from.

### local-deepthink: Democratizing Deep Thought üß†

I am also the creator of **local-deepthink**, an open-source research platform that explores emergent intelligence on affordable, local hardware. This project challenges the paradigm of centralized, proprietary AI by simulating a society of AI agents that collaborate, evolve, and deepen their understanding collectively over time.

At its core, `local-deepthink` runs a novel conceptual algorithm I developed called a **Qualitative Neural Network (QNN)**. In a QNN, different AI agents act as "neurons" that critique and refine each other's ideas. It's a system designed to trade slow, iterative computation for higher-quality, more comprehensive outputs, embodying the principle that true insight develops through interaction and reflection, not just brute-force processing.


Key features include:
*   **Emergent Problem Solving:** The network can decompose complex problems, re-frame its own goals, and learn from its outputs over multiple cycles (epochs). Learns sytem prompts on the go.
*   **QNN Export/Import:** The entire trained agent network can be exported to a lightweight JSON file, allowing others to use and build upon the "mined" intelligence.
*   **Interactive RAG & Diagnostics:** Users can chat directly with the network's entire "thought process" and chat with specific neurons to gain deeper insights and diagnose agent behavior.

Future features:

* **Higher neuron variety***: leverage image to 3D models, model them as neurons to create scenarios; same as image analysis, and image generation neurons.

You can explore the project, see the preliminary results, and contribute to this experiment on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/andres-ulloa-de-la-torre/local-deepthink).

If you are a AI Lab and you are interested in using QNNs to train a foundational model, or fine tune an existing one, reach out with the details and i'll be glad to be involved.

## üìù My Thoughts

Here are some of the core themes I explore in my articles:

*   **The Limits of Current AGI Research:** Why thinking like a traditional AI researcher is insufficient for achieving true general intelligence and the need to aim for a higher-level understanding of consciousness and physics.
*   **Gravity, Attention, and Consciousness:** Exploring the analogies between physical laws (like gravity) and cognitive processes (like attention), and how they shape our subjective reality.
*   **The Nature of Neural Networks:** A deeper dive into what MLPs are actually doing, framing them as systems of routing and data motion rather than just linear algebra operations.
*   **Beyond AGI:** Arguing for a shift in focus from data-centric models to fedback operator-centric models, inspired by control systems like PID loops, to achieve breakthroughs in AI.
*   **Pseudoscience as a Tool not a belief:** Leveraging symbolic frameworks like MBTI and astrology as powerful, linguistically-loaded systems for generating complex and nuanced personas in GenAI.

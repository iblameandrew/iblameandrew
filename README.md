# Hi, I'm a philosopher, engineer, and researcher.

I'm currently exploring the intersection of consciousness, physics, and computation. My work is grounded in a "World of Wheels" cosmovision, viewing the universe as a nested system of harmonic oscillators. I believe that true breakthroughs in artificial intelligence will not come from scaling current architectures alone, but from a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of nature.

My ruminiating over the years argues that current AI models are like integrators without a differential ‚Äîthey can approximate functions but lack the feedback mechanisms that drive genuine understanding. This has led me to explore nature-inspired methods and control theory, like PID loops, as a path toward more robust and conscious-like AI. I'm particularly interested in the science of loops and oscillators as a precise language for describing consciousness. You can find my musings on these topics in my blog, where I dissect everything from the emergent complexity of MLPs to the metaphysical implications of gravity and attention.

## üî≠ Current Project: Portals

I am currently developing **Portals**, an open-source platform for automatic videogame synthesis based on a person's elicited focal points of attention.

The core idea behind Portals is to create a system that can translate the subtle, often unconscious, points of interest of a persons hierarchy of values and affordances, into a coherent visual narrative. Instead of relying solely on explicit text prompts, Portals will leverage novel techniques to capture and interpret a user's focus, generating a playable videomgame that is deeply resonant with their internal state.

## üìù My Thoughts

Here are some of the core themes I explore in my articles:

*   **The Limits of Current AGI Research:** Why thinking like a traditional AI researcher is insufficient for achieving true general intelligence and the need to aim for a higher-level understanding of consciousness and physics.
*   **Gravity, Attention, and Consciousness:** Exploring the analogies between physical laws (like gravity) and cognitive processes (like attention), and how they shape our subjective reality.
*   **The Nature of Neural Networks:** A deeper dive into what MLPs are actually doing, framing them as systems of routing and data motion rather than just linear algebra operations.
*   **Beyond AGI:** Arguing for a shift in focus from data-centric models to fedback operator-centric models, inspired by control systems like PID loops, to achieve breakthroughs in AI.
*   **Pseudoscience as a Tool not a belief:** Leveraging symbolic frameworks like MBTI and astrology as powerful, linguistically-loaded systems for generating complex and nuanced personas in GenAI.
